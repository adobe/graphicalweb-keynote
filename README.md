## Overview

Quest for the Graphical Web

This is an experimental experience showcasing current and coming features of the graphical web. Some of the features are working specifications and may not be implemented by current browsers.

Branches:

MASTER - represents the presentation version presented at the Create The Web Conference, which can be seen on youtube at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2Yj-8zGa3U

WEB - represents the web optimized version which can be seen at http://thegraphicalweb.com

The site can be run out of the src folder, but requires a local server, like MAMP (http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html), to run. The build script uses PHING to compile/compress all the working files into the site directory for a compressed version.

Tools to build
* Require.js (http://requirejs.org/)
* SASS (http://sass-lang.com/) 
* Compass (http://compass-style.org/)
* PHING (http://www.phing.info/trac/)
